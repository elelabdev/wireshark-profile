# Security Policy

Thank you for using **wireshark-profile**! This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities, which versions I support, and how I handle security reports.


## Supported Versions

I maintain security support for the following release lines:

- **`main`** (latest stable): receives patches and updates.  


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please **report it on GitHub**:

1. Go to the repository’s **Security** tab.  
2. Click **“Report a vulnerability”** (or “New security advisory”).  
3. Provide:
   - Affected version(s)  
   - Description of the vulnerability  
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept  
   - Any relevant logs or crash dumps  

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**  
   I aim to acknowledge every valid report.  
2. **Assessment**  
   I will evaluate severity and plan a fix.  
3. **Fix & Disclosure**  
   - I will merge a patch into `main`.
   - I will update the private advisory when a fix is available.  
4. **Public Advisory**  
   Once fixes are published, I may release a public note summarizing the issue and resolution.

*Thank you for helping keep **wireshark-profile** secure!*
